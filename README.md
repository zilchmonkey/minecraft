## Installation

To run this prototype locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minecraft-prototype.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to play!

## How to Play Locally

Once the game is running in your browser, you can interact with the environment as follows:

- Use **W**, **A**, **S**, **D** to move around:

  - **W** - Move forward
  - **A** - Move left
  - **S** - Move backward
  - **D** - Move right

- Press **1**, **2**, **3**, or **4** to select different types of blocks to place.

- Move the mouse to look around the environment.

- Click the left mouse button to place the selected block onto the plane.
